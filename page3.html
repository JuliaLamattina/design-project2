            <p class="healing">Once you know how to care for your injury and you've given your body enough time to rest, now is the time to focus on maintaining your cardiovascular fitness and building strength for the rest of your body. Since you shouldn't be doing anything too intense on your injured area, now is when you can focus on strengthening the rest of your body. For example, if you have injured your shoulder or upper body, it is recommended to do more leg focused exercises, such as squats and lunges, and avoid using your arms. <br><br>

                If you want to have a quick recuperation when going back to your sport, it is also very important to maintain your cardio. If you stop physical activity all together because you're injured, it will be a very difficult transition back into the game. Not only will your muscles be weak from lack of use, but your stamina will not be up to par. In order to avoid a setback like this, you should definitely implement cardiovascular exercises into your routine. <br><br>
                
                These exercises can be a little tricky if you have injured your lower body because in this case you obviously don't want to be doing any kind of intense running. Depending on the severity of your injury, another option could be a light jog, walk or swimming with a floaty between your legs.
