            <p class="about">My name is Julia LaMattina and I am a secondary 3 student at St. Thomas High school. I come from a fairly athletic family and one of my favorite ways to spend my time is on the field. Since the age of 4, I have been playing soccer, making it a very big part of my life. Throughout my career as an athlete, I have encountered many injuries and there have been a few occasions where they really affected my place in my sport. Struggling with my own injuries is what gave me the inspiration for this website. I wanted to really understand their effects and figure out if there was a way to make them less of a burden. My goal was to find what healing methods are best and which ones will help cut down the recovery time and get injured athletes back in the game as quickly as possible.
