            <p class="healing">Once you have properly diagnosed your injury, next you must figure out what it needs and give it the time it needs to heal. As I mentioned before all injuries are different and require different care. With this in mind, they still all require a combination of rest and exercise, knowing how much of each is key. <br><br>

                Finding the perfect combination of these two aspects, depending on the severity of your injury, is the base of the healing process. Focusing too much on resting will lead to a slower and weak recovery, often resulting in re-injuring the area. On the other hand, moving too much too soon can worsen the injury and will significantly affect your recovery. Because of this, it is hard to give a generic healing plan but a few things that physiotherapists suggest are applying the technique RICE and executing moderate movement. <br><br>
                
                <a href="https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/rice-method-injuries" target="_blank">RICE</a> is a four step process that involves rest, ice, compression and elevation. These four points are needed by common injuries such as sprains. <br><br>
                
                After protecting the injured area for the first 3 to 5 days, physical therapists suggest moving your injury in order to improve blood circulation and promote healing. <br><br>
