                The very first step to recovery is diagnosing and understanding your injury. Before you can start to heal you have to find what it is that you injured, what type of injury you have and also what caused the injury in the first <br><br>
                
                Properly diagnosing your injury with the help of a physiotherapist is essential because all injuries are different and therefore need different care. For example, a strain or sprain will require simple range-of-motion stretches but a broken bone must stay very still in order to heal.<br><br>
                
                Understanding why you got injured where you did will also help avoid future issues. Some injuries are caused due to lack of strength and can be avoided by building up muscles. If this is the case for you, instead of healing the area up to where it was before the injury, you should probably look into getting it stronger in order to avoid repetitive abuse.
